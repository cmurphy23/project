  Number of Slice Registers:                    81 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  81
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         66 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as logic:                       64 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              21
      Number using O5 output only:              16
      Number using O5 and O6:                   27
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         2
  Number of route-thrus:                        19
    Number using O6 output only:                18
    Number using O5 output only:                 1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    40 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           91
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            10 out of      91   10%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  25 out of      91   27%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          56 out of      91   61%
    Number of unique control sets:              12
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              23 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        36 out of     640    5%

    Number using BlockRAM only:                  1
    Total primitives used:
      Number of 18k BlockRAM used:               1
    Total Memory used (KB):                     18 out of   5,328    1%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1
