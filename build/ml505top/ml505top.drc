WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net chipscope_control<13> is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal
   <fifo_generator_v9_1/U0/xst_fifo_generator/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/gntv_or_sync_f
   ifo.gl0.wr/gwhf.whf/overflow_i_and0000> is incomplete. The signal does not
   drive any load pins in the design.
DRC detected 0 errors and 2 warnings.  Please see the previously displayed
individual error or warning messages for more details.
